This is my solution for the Valid Palindrome problem on LeetCode. First, I lowercase all the characters in the given strings so there won't be any irregularities. Then I create two empty arrays. In one array, I append all the alphanumerical values of the given string into that array. In the second, I do the same except it's reversed. Then you compare them at the end and if they match the same characters then it returns true. If they don't contain the same characters, it returns false.
